                        README
                        ------

This repository contains scripts to do the following:
	i.	obtain data from collectd csv files
	ii.	obtain data from ActiveState Stackato via stackato command line.
	iii.	write above data into BUS files (BUS Format), a format that is required
		for presenting in (HP) vPV tree-maps.

                     DEPENDENCIES
                     ------------

The scripts rely on the following settings and perl modules:
	i.	csv plugin is enabled in collectd.conf file
		read "editing collectd.conf" section below.
	ii.	perl modules JSON and Text::CSV_XS modules are installed
		# JSON module
		 [[ wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MA/MAKAMAKA/JSON-2.53.tar.gz ]]
		# TEXT::CSV_XS module
		 [[ wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/H/HM/HMBRAND/Text-CSV_XS-0.93.tgz ]]
	iii.	stackato command-line is installed

                       TESTING
                       -------

The scripts have been tested to work with ActiveState Stackato micro-cloud version 2.4.3.
Testing with 2.6.6 currently.

                        BUGS
                        ----

	i.	createbusfiles script will not run automatically on reboot - cron job fails to run.
		Need to run 'stackato login', and provide a valid username and password, then run
		the createbusfiles script.

                       RUNNING
                       -------

Run the script 'createbusfiles' (shell script).

                     RUN AS REGULAR TASK
                     -------------------

To add the createbusfiles script as a cron job, add the following line to the crontab.

*/5 * * * * ~/stackato_stats/createbusfiles <time>m <fqdn.of.vpv.server>

The above task runs every 5 minutes. Need to test with smaller intervals.

                  EDITING collectd.conf
                  ---------------------

To enable collectd.conf, follow the steps below.

	i.	Uncomment the following line
		  # LoadPlugin csv
	ii.	Uncomment the details for csv plugin settings
		 Change:
		  # <Plugin csv>
		  #   DataDir "/var/lib/collectd/csv"
		  #   StoreRates false
		  # </Plugin>
		 To:
		  <Plugin csv>
		    DataDir "/var/lib/collectd/csv"
		    StoreRates true
		  </Plugin>

		NOTE: Ensure that the StoreRates setting is 'true'.
		This ensures that collectd writes cpu utilization rates, instead
		of 'raw' cumulative values.
	Do not forget to restart collectd after changing the settings.
		sudo /etc/init.d/collectd restart
