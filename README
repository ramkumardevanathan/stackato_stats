                        README
                        ------


This repository contains scripts to do the following:
	i.	obtain data from collectd csv files
	ii.	obtain data from ActiveState Stackato via stackato command line.
	iii.	write above data into BUS files (BUS Format), a format that is required
		for presenting in (HP) vPV tree-maps.

                     DEPENDENCIES
                     ------------

The scripts rely on the following settings and perl modules:
	i.	csv plugin is enabled in collectd.conf file
		read "editing collectd.conf" section below.
	ii.	perl modules JSON, Text::CSV and Text::CSV_XS modules are installed
		# JSON module
		 [[ wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MA/MAKAMAKA/JSON-2.53.tar.gz ]]
		# TEXT::CSV module
		 [[ wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MA/MAKAMAKA/Text-CSV-1.21.tar.gz ]]
		# TEXT::CSV_XS module
		 [[ wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/H/HM/HMBRAND/Text-CSV_XS-0.93.tgz ]]
	iii.	stackato command-line is installed

                       TESTING
                       -------

The scripts have been tested to work with ActiveState Stackato micro-cloud version 2.4.3.

                       RUNNING
                       -------

Run the script 'createbusfiles' (shell script).


                  EDITING collectd.conf
                  ---------------------

To enable collectd.conf, follow the steps below.

	i.	Uncomment the following line
		  # LoadPlugin csv
	ii.	Uncomment the details for csv plugin settings
		  # <Plugin csv>
		  # DataDir "/var/lib/collectd/csv"
		  # StoreRates false
		  # </Plugin>
		NOTE: Ensure that the StoreRates setting is 'true'.
		This ensures that collectd writes cpu utilization rates, instead
		of 'raw' cumulative values.
